# Context

These context diagrams are a good starting point, allowing visualisation of the big picture.

The highest level, the System Landscape Diagram, focusses on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies, protocols and other low-level details.

* The Regional Schools Commissioner initiates the transfer, but it is the Project Lead who uses the Academy Transfers system to progress the transfer.
* An Academy moves from the Source Trust to the Target Trust.
* The Developer uses their Local Development Environment to push code to GitHub, which then automatically tests and deploys it when appropriate.

The System Context diagram zooms in a little, showing just the users who interact directly with the system and the system itself - the Developers and Project Leads.
