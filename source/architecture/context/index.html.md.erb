# Context

There are three overarching stages in the transfer of an Academy, and the system currently deals with the first:

1. Pre-advisory board - Delivery Officer puts together a case which will be downloaded as a Word document from Sharepoint.
2. Advisory board meeting - a meeting to review the case and come to a decision.
3. Post-advisory board - here it is mainly paperwork which is completed - employment, land and financial transfer happen in this phase.

These system landscape diagram shows the big picture for this first stage.

Here we see:

* The Regional Schools Commissioner initiates the transfer, but it is the Delivery Officer who uses the Academy Transfers system to progress the transfer.
* An Academy moves from the Source Trust to the Target Trust.
* The Developer uses their Local Development Environment to push code to GitHub, which then automatically tests and deploys it when appropriate.

The System Context diagram zooms in a little, showing just the users who interact directly with the system and the system itself - the Developers and Delivery Officers.
