# Architecture

The Architecture Team decided to use the [C4 Model] to visual the Software Architecture for the Service.

Within the C4 Model there are four levels of diagram, each taking a more concrete and less abstract view of the system as you go down the list:

* Context
* Containers
* Components
* Code

We have also used the additional Deployment diagram type to illustate the deployment environments.

All diagrams are stored as code in the [repository for this site] and have been automatically generated using [Structurizr].
