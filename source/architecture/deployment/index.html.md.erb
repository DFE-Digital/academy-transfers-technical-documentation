# Deployment

The Academy Transfers service is hosted in GOV.UK PaaS, whereas the Academies API is in Azure (DfE T1) due to the preference to be co-located with the SQL database and it's associated Azure Data Factory pipelines.

Containerization is utilized for the Academy Transfers service, with GOV.UK PaaS providing horizontally scaling hosting and a Redis session store.
