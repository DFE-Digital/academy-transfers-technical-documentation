# About

This is the Technical Documentation supporting the Beta phase of the Academy Transfer Service.

It utilises the [Tech Docs Template] in the [GitHub Tech Docs Code].

The Service Team have decided to the [C4 Model] to visualise the architecture for the service.

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described in this [ADR Blog Post] are also used to record key decisions.
